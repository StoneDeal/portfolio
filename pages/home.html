<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p>
    I went to Kansas City, Missouri, where I studied web development with LaunchCode. 
    After receiving my certificate, I returned to Texas where I've been continuing to expand my education and experience. 
    I am passionate about creating sleek and efficient web apps with vanilla JavaScript or JavaScript based frameworks.
