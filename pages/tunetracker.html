<h3>What it is:</h3>
<p>Tune Tracker is a web app I created to help people find new bands to listen to. 
    Using the LastFM API, Tune Tracker provides recommended bands based on what the user likes.
</p>
<h3>How it was built:</h3>
<p>
    Using JavaScript on the front-end, and JQuery for DOM manipulation, 
    the site can make calls the the API and return popular artists and search results. 
    I implemented the ability to create a profile and like artists, as well as routing to different pages, using server-side Python code and a MySQL database.
    Once a user has liked artists in the database, 
    that information is passed to the JavaScript where an API call retrieves and displays recommendations.
